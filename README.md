# Dumpster Diving
Went looking in a dying SSD, decided to get it updated and on new exports (that's how long it's not been used.)
Got a new project coming along so I thought why not bring it back and get it ready for the new server.

## QB-Target

QB-Target --> init.lua

                label = "Search Trash",
            },
        },
        distance = 3.0
